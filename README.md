# Milady Poland Mint page

The page calls a microservice from my [ECDSA Signature Microservice](https://github.com/kryptopaul/ecdsa_signature_microservice) to verify if the connected wallet owns a Milady or a ThePolacy NFT. If so, it receives a signature later passed to the contract to allow the user mint it for free. 

Tech stack: Wagmi.sh, RainbowKit, Mantine UI, Typescript.
