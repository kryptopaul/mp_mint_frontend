# Milady Poland Mint page

The page calls a microservice from https://github.com/kryptopaul/ethers_util to verify if the connected wallet owns a Milady or a ThePolacy NFT. If so, it receives a signature later passed to the contract to allow the user mint it for free. 

Tech stack: Wagmi.sh, Mantine UI, Typescript.
